# ND Contact Details

WordPress plugin designed to help you manage the contact details for your website.

Allows you to set global phone numbers and email addresses for a website, to be displayed in the footer or sidebar of your website, for example.

Contact details can also be overridden at a page level with a fallback to the global contact details, when nothing is set.

Following similar logic, a child page will automatically inherit the contact details of its ancestor pages, by default, if no details are set for it.

All views are configurable, but by default are designed to be in line with schema.org guidelines for the relevant contact detail.

Requires:

- the Advanced Custom Fields plugin
- developer integration with your WordPress theme
